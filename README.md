# apm - Android Permission Manager

This app allows you setting app permission in Android. It allows you to test apps faster and get bypass runtime-permissions.


## Requirements

You will need adb (Android Debugging Bridge) working on your machine. To check if it's working just open 
the command prompt / Terminal and run `abd devices`. 


## How to use

Start this tool and set app permissions without a hassle. Just follow the GUI, which should be self-explanatory.

To get an overview of the Android Permission Model, check the [docs](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html).
